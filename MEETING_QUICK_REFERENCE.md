## 🤔 ANTICIPATED QUESTIONS

### "Is it really ready for production?"
**Answer:** "Yes. Builds successfully, no critical errors, all major features operational. Only minor optimizations remain. Ready to deploy and start campaigns today."

### "What about the security issues?"
**Answer:** "4 moderate vulnerabilities in development dependencies only. They don't affect production builds or deployment. We're monitoring for updates, but not critical."

### "Can it actually operate autonomously?"
**Answer:** "Yes, with safety controls. AI makes decisions, executes actions, learns from outcomes. But we have action limits, emergency shutoffs, and manual override capabilities."

### "How does it compare to VICIdial?"
**Answer:** "Same core algorithms, but modern architecture with superior AI. VICIdial has more legacy features, we have better automation and easier deployment."

### "What's not working?"
**Answer:** "Honestly, nothing critical. All features build and function. We have code quality warnings and bundle size to optimize, but no broken functionality."

### "Can we scale this?"
**Answer:** "Absolutely. Serverless architecture auto-scales. Designed for high throughput with parallel processing. Can handle thousands of simultaneous calls."

### "What about compliance?"
**Answer:** "That's our strength. Real-time FCC monitoring, automatic enforcement, TCPA compliance, DNC scrubbing, complete audit trails. More compliant than manual systems."

### "Can we customize it?"
**Answer:** "Yes. Highly customizable UI, white-label ready, can add custom integrations. Built with modern, maintainable code."
