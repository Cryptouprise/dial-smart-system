## ✅ My Recommendation

**Don't sell cheap.**

Absolute minimum: **$350,000**

But I recommend:

1. **Spend 30 days validating** (follow the plan above)
2. **Get 2-3 beta customers** at $297-597/month
3. **Then decide:**
   - Sell for $500K-750K (proven market interest)
   - License for $750K-1.2M (recurring revenue)
   - Build to $2M-10M (maximize value)

**Why?** 30 days of work could be worth $200K-400K more. Worth it.
